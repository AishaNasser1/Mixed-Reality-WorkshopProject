## Mixed Reality room configurator

   The main scene is under  Assets/Scene/**SampleScene** .

   This scene showcases my room configurator. It consists of a `palm-up` `scrollable` menu, which when a button is pressed, the selected `item spawns`. The spawned objects have the `Tap to Place` component and can be manipulated to `move/rotate/scale`. The menu displayed can be changed between one of the `three rooms` available (living room, kitchen and bedroom). Also, the menu counts with a button to toggle the `Follow me` behavior and another button that `deletes all` the objects spawned in the scene.
   
   Enjoy!
